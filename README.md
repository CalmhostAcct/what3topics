## 🧠 About the Project

**What3Topics** was inspired by the idea of *“what3words”* — mapping locations with three random words — but instead of physical locations, we map **ideas**.

Whether you're brainstorming startup names, writing prompts, art ideas, or just having fun generating creative combinations, What3Topics helps you turn randomness into inspiration.

The **👾 alien monster logo** symbolizes creativity, imagination, and the playful spirit of exploration that drives open-source innovation.
